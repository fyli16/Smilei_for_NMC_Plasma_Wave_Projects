This is a fork of the open-source particle-in-cell code [SMILEI](https://github.com/SmileiPIC/Smilei). General [doc](https://smileipic.github.io/Smilei/)

I developed additional features to enable open-boundary simulation of Alfven wave and whistler-mode chorus waves with relevance to laboraotry and space plasma physics. 

To checkout these further developments, switch to the branch 'Alfven_wave' or 'chorus_dipole'. 

Reach out to me (lif02501 [at] gmail.com) if you have questions about the setups and usage.
